# RTTTL Console Beep Sample

This is a small example of how to parse and play rtttl (Ring Tone Text Transfer Language) in a .NET console app. (_This only works on Windows_)

## Play a tune.

```shell
ConsoleBeep.exe "Simpsons:d=4,o=5,b=160:c.6,e6,f#6,8a6,g.6,e6,c6,8a,8f#,8f#,8f#,2g,8p,8p,8f#,8f#,8f#,8g,a#.,8c6,8c6,8c6,c6"
```
